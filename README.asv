Automated detection and classification of retinal abnormalities in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
images are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning in ophthalmology. In this work, a hybrid 
methodology is introduced that combines traditional image processing techniques with deep learning for improved 
segmentation and classification accuracy. The preprocessing pipeline begins with grayscale conversion and contrast 
enhancement using Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Segmentation is performed using a combination of 
Otsuâ€™s thresholding, morphological operations, and K-Means clustering, followed by refinement using the Active Contour 
(Snake) algorithm. These steps isolate key regions of interest in the retinal layers, focusing on abnormalities such as fluid
filled areas or distorted tissue structures. From the segmented images, quantitative features including area, eccentricity, 
perimeter, and circularity are extracted to understand the shape characteristics of the abnormal regions. These segmented 
images are then used to train a deep learning model based on the GoogleNet architecture, enabling robust classification of 
retinal conditions. During testing, raw OCT scan images undergo the same segmentation and feature extraction pipeline 
before classification, ensuring consistency between training and testing datasets. The integrated approach leverages the 
precision of classical segmentation techniques and the powerful feature learning capabilities of deep convolutional 
networks. This method enhances the reliability of OCT-based diagnostic systems and can be potentially extended to other 
forms of medical imaging. The system provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for aiding ophthalmologists in the 
early detection of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.
